# Odd helpers

A collection of odd helpers for various types. The lib is not intended to be
included as-is, but rather copy/pasted into your own code as needed.

Basically, I am tired of searching for functions like `compose`,  `fuzzySearch`
or `padStart` whenever I need them, and this repository is a place for me to
store them until next time I need them.

No tests, because I am lazy and it's getting late here.
